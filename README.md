# Brat Games Case

#AirCraft Mini Game

#This project made for Brat Games Case


Goal :

• We are controlling an aircraft on the air and trying to reach final destination.


Game Flow :

• We’ll be driving a plane on the air .

• We need to coincide some checkpoints on the way .

• If we break the line and miss some it will lower our score and also If we go too far and leave the
map, we will have to return with a warning letter or it will be a fail .

• It is not compulsory for us to take off and return from an airport, but if you want to use the
airport package, this is included in our package.

• There may be an accelerator pedal to the left or right that controls acceleration and deceleration.

• You can use unity’s own plane generator to make some mountains etc.


o Some of the topics to be considered in case study are as follows:


▪ Smooth aircraft control and realistic movement in the air .

▪ Some particle effects that increase the sense of achievement in successful checkpoints .

In case of miss, our score will decrease.

▪ Acceleration of the aircraft during takeoff and slowing down after landing(Landing could
be automatic after last check point) .

▪ Crashing scene If we hit ground.


Controls: -Joystick to control our air craft , Swerve to acceleration and deceleration .


Camera Angle: Third Person .
